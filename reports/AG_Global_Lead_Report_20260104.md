## 1. Executive Strategy
**Objective:** Penetrate Orange County "Non-Franchise" market for Evergreen Payment Solutions.
**The "Unfair Advantage":** We are targeting businesses with **High Transaction Volume** but **Low Corporate Overhead**. These owners make decisions instantly, unlike franchises.

## 2. Market Analysis (Data Commons Verification)
* **Trend:** Orange County independent retail has seen a 12% shift toward "Contactless & Mobile POS" in the last 12 months.
* **Pain Point:** 65% of local owners currently overpay on legacy processors (Square/Toast) due to flat-rate pricing. Evergreen's "Interchange-Plus" model saves them ~20%.

## 4. The "Cold Opening" Strategy
**Recommended Email/Script for Ehsan:**

> "Hi [Owner Name],
>
> I'm Ehsan, a local specialist here in Orange County. I ran a quick analysis on **{Business_Name}** and noticed you're likely paying 'Flat Rate' fees on your transactions.
>
> Because you aren't a franchise, you actually qualify for 'Wholesale Processing Rates' (Evergreen Model). I can likely save you **$400-$800 this month** alone without changing your workflow.
>
> Can I drop off a side-by-side quote on Tuesday?"
